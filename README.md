[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/hyoka.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/hyoka)

Rust library for anyone that wants to implement their own REPL programs.
I created this library while I was following this tutorial some anon suggested [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).

See [examples](./examples) to see how to use it.
